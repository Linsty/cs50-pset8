  <h3>Thanks CS50, a quick review! </h3>
  <p>Nice that you ended up on this page. <br>
    Although this page is online and the content isn’t nonsense, I built this webpage as a study assignment for pset8 of the Harvard CS50 2021 course.<br>
    This course has taught me a lot and I can recommend it to anyone who wants to learn a little more than the standard tutorials that you can find everywhere on the internet.<br>
    I think it's a pretty tough course, but it's a lot of fun to do. <br>
    It’s almost mandatory to have good English skills if you want to attend to this course. <br>
    In general my English skill are fine but I had my struggles once in a while.</p>

  <p>Although I still have some lessons to go, I am already quite far in the course. I therefore have the feeling that I will finish the course soon.</p>

  <p>I think the structure of the lessons is very good. The lectures are fun but since 2021 they last between 2.5 and 3 hours. <br>
    David Malan is a fluent speaker and does not repeat endlessly. Thus you get a lot of information during this time. <br>
    I personally love that, but if you find this too hard, you can always pause the lesson.
  <p>
  <p>If you are more lyrically oriented, you also can read back the entire colleague. <br>
    In case the curriculum was still a bit too hard for you, then Doug Lloyd's videos came in handy.<br>
    You can absolutely say the course offers you enough visual and textual materials.</p>
  <p>If you think the lessons are tough, I can tell you that the assignments are often at least as tough. <br>
    In general, after reading the text and the clear videos of Brian Yu, I figured it out, <br>
    but sometimes I really didn't understand what to make at all. So the question how to make it wasn’t even there. <br>
    In those moments I felt like I couldn't speak English at all. But when I finally figured everything out I really was over the moon.</p>
  <p>The course facilities are excellent. A well-functioning IDE (Integrated development environment), manuals, links to communities, etc. <br>
    Actually, I only missed 2 facilities.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>A facility where I could take notes. I find this very easy with courses in Udemy.</li>
    <li>A link to a manual for the terminal commands. </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Obviously I am absolutely nitpicking, but if Harvard would add this in their course <br>
    I would grade them a 10 in a scale from 1 to 10 instead of the 9.5 now. </p>
  <em><b>I'm not there yet. But thank you Harvard for this great experience!</b></em>
